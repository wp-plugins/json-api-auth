*Thanks to 'mattberg' who developed the auth controller. I have authored it as a WordPress plugin so that it could easily be searched and installed. mattberg made Auth controller available here https://github.com/mattberg/wp-json-api-auth

* There are three methods available: validate_auth_cookie(), generate_auth_cookie(), get_currentuserinfo()

* nonce can be created by calling http://your-domain/api/get_nonce/?controller=auth&method=generate_auth_cookie

* You can then use 'nonce' value to generate cookie. http://your-domain/api/auth/generate_auth_cookie/?nonce=f4320f4a67&username=Catherine&password=password-here
